Solutions to Java assignment problems (Combinations, FizzBuzz, Employee Map)

### ✅ Problem 1 – Combination Sum
**File:** `CombinationSum.java`  
- Takes a user-defined array and a target number as input.
- Prints all unique combinations that sum up to the target.
- Handles duplicate values and uses backtracking efficiently.

### ✅ Problem 2 – FizzBuzz
**File:** `FizzBuzz.java`  
- Prints numbers from 1 to 100.
- Prints `Fizz` if divisible by 3, `Buzz` if divisible by 5, and `FizzBuzz` if divisible by both.
- Minimizes `if` conditions using string concatenation logic.

### ✅ Problem 3 – Employee & Department Mapping
**Files:**
- `Employee.java`
- `Department.java`
- `EmployeeDepartmentManager.java`

**Functionality:**
- Maps 10 Employees to Departments using a `Map<Employee, Department>`.
- Retrieves all employees.
- Filters employees with salary > input.
- Sorts employees by salary (ascending/descending).
- Identifies the department with the most employees.

## ▶️ How to Run

Each `.java` file contains a `main()` method. You can compile and run them individually:

```bash
javac CombinationSum.java
java CombinationSum
